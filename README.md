Synopsis

The following is a level design created for an arcade drifting game. I tried to use various real traffic objects to make the city feel 
a little more real and lived in. This level takes place in a very dense city - if you look around you'll find various public transportation stops,
parking lots, a gas station and commercial buildings, construction, etc. The rough path and various objects hopefully will point you in the 
right direction to get you back to the starting point, but since this is a drifting game this isn't really necessary. Think of it as being
scored on style instead of speed. How many drifting stunts (kissing the wall, landing jumps, combos, side-switching, etc)can the player pull off before the 
timer runs out or the car is destroyed?


Known issues:
- Controlling the car is difficult - it slips and slides all over. While it is possible to consistently drift it is incredibly difficult.
If you want to play through the level you'll have to use a little bit of your imagination or play in simulate mode to fix the car if/when you crash.

- It can be a little slow if you want to adjust geometry because of the amount of actors and their scale. 

- All the glass in the level can be destroyed but sometimes get caught in the wheel and make the car stuck. Same thing for the chasm on the bridge

- The reverse button has a mind of it's own. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Unsure of why.
